<p>This project uses a potential function to dictate the motion of particles. The potential function changes the acceleration for each discretized time step of every particle. Particles repel eachother at close distances preventing overlapping collisions. Currently there is no friction or damping. This project was written in Python and uses Tkinter for graphics.</p>
